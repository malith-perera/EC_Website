-->

<!-- What can you do with extended C-->
<p>
Using <cite>Extended C</cite> you can develop any type of applications fast and easily than ever. Spectially the performance critical applications in a shoot. Furthermore if you like to follow the EC coding guidelines not even you can write high speed applications it also allows you to decrease your development time dramatically because of itâ€™s clear structured nature allows you to develop more complex programs in simple way with <em>objects in mind</em>. You can achieve this goals more easily using <cite>extended C</cite> with your C program.
</p>


<!-- What do you have to know to use extended C-->
<p>If you know C basics it won't take much time you to grab the essence of EC. Because EC is just C, there is nothing you have to follow syntax rules other than C.</p>
